Wed 4th September
Today we studied about how to  create a program that by entering the numbers
or data we can find the answer. First we need to do is to install the GitHub
then we can create a program. For example we decide to create a program for 
finding our age in days. what we need to do is to write 
#!/bin/bash
#This is a comment
#This program will calculate my age in days 
((age = 365 * 17))
echo " My age in day"

Then save it by pressing CTRL+X then y

for using the programing write : 
bash+ name of your program. Then you can enter the numbers and get the answer.

Second program was to create a program for calculating the area of rectangel. 
create area.sh 
calculate the area of rectangel 
nano+ name of the file 
bash+ name of the program
