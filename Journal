Today we studied about 1.1.1 Identify context for which a new system is planned.I learnd some of the most important notes
like feasibility report, TELOS, usablility and so on. Then we studied some codes to order to show the list directly(ls)
and  changing directly (cd). by these codes we are able to see what we have in our computer. then we studied about how to 
create a folder in desktop or any other place that we like, for making folder we can use the code (mkdir) then the name of 
the folder that we to create. Next we can create file in our folder. we can use (cat) for showing the content of a file. we 
learned about (nano), I forgot what we can do with nano.
