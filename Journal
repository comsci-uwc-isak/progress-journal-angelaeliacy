Today, Augest 28,  is first class of Computer Science with Dr. Pinzon. I learned that what is essetial is invisable. So 
computer is languge of codes which are invisible so we have to find. I learned about ROT 13, that alphabets has another face
too. Then I learned about Terminal; by terminal and entering the code of the file there we can find that file in desktop. 
Finally, what was interesting for me was knowing hand language which you can talk by your hand. Today`s activity made me more 
excited about computer Science although I was not good at but I have to try and know what is going on.
